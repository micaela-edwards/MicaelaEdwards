                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The word Epilepsy comes from an ancient Greek word that means to grab, seizure or attack. When an individual has two or more seizures of random occurrence, he/she is considered to have epilepsy.&nbsp;<br>A seizure is caused when there is an imbalance in the neurotransmitters which leads to a burst of electrical activity in the brain where abnormal electrical signals are sent meaning the messages get jumbled up and may lead to a seizure or peculiar actions. &nbsp;There are a variety of 'signals' indicating a chance of having a seizure such as a few moments of blank staring, confused blabbering, violent muscles spasms or total loss of consciousness. Although many possible causes have been determined, 70% of those with epilepsy are idiopathic meaning the cause cannot be pinpointed. The disorder is commonly passed down through generations and a large proportion of epileptics come from a family with epileptic history. If one parent suffers from the disorder, their child has a 6% chance of also suffering from epilepsy, just like if both parents have epilepsy the chances jump to 12%.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Elliot-Wright, S.
