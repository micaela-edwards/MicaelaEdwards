                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">There are several different elements to seizures and specific ways to classify them. To reduce the risk of injuries and potential death, understanding the instructions to helping an epileptic seizure is neccessary.<br> A Complex Partial Seizure is when  one will seem confused and wander around as if they were gazed or drunk and won't seem aware of what it is theyâ€™re doing. Guide them away from any possible danger and talk gently. Simple partial seizure is when the person will experience strange feelings. Stay with them and talk reassuringly while the seizure lasts. A Tonic and Atonic seizure is when the person falls down then quickly recovers. Check for injuries and stay with them till they are fully recovered. Absence seizures is where the person will have brief interruptions of awareness as if they are daydreaming. Guide them away from any danger. In case of an emergency, generally calling an ambulance is a priority along with leading them away from danger to prevent dangerous situations. Remaining calm and focusing about what you're doing is most important.&nbsp;<br>Each seizure is accompanied by personal confusing emotions. Each is made up of different sounds, scents, sights, tastes, and physical feelings. Warning signals will sometimes occur depending on the person though not always. These will warn the person allowing time to notify others around. Many affects can be triggered by other aspects but some are completely random. Every drug has a different direct effects on the brain. By heavy drinking, one with epilepsy has a high risk of having a seizure being increased by 50-60% chance. Though, medical drugs are suitable for chances of preventing seizures or reactions. These types of drugs can also be used to identify signals before a seizure.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br> </p>
