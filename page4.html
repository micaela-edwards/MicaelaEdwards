Even today, some cultures around the world consider someone having seizures as being possessed. Although epilepsy has been classified as a disorder and is seen as a disorder rather than being possessed, there are still many boundaries and limits for those with Epilepsy.&nbsp;<br>These limitations do not apply to all with Epilepsy though, many are denied the right to serve their country during wartime along with being unable to drive after a certain point or obtain certain jobs being more prone to accidents, not only to themselves, but others around them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Modern treatment of seizures started in 1850 with the introduction of bromides. Bromides was a drug introduced by Sir Charles Locock, firstly tested on 11 patients from ages 2-17. &nbsp;Now classified as a first generation anti-epileptic drug (AED), bromides were used for over 50 years. Treatements vary based on the level of severness and each individual themselves. Majority will take tablets up to 3 times a day.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Epilepsy Education Everywhere | History of Epilepsy
